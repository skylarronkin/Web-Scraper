# Web-Scraper
 
This code was written in Python. Scrape.py is the main file where the program is run. It uses the Beautiful Soup package to parse the IMDB list of top 250 movies. It goes through each of the top movies and gets the year each was released and its rating. It displays the average year and average rating of the top movies. It also calculates the year range of movies on the list. The user is then asked to choose a number from 1 - 250, which will prompt the program to print out information about the movie with that rank (name of the movie, year released, director, etc.).
